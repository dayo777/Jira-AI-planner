## Jira AI-planner (Atlassian Codegeist 2024)

This extension provides a tool to assist project managers, team leaders, and anyone in effectively planning and structuring their tasks to achieve their project goals.

## How it works
Our project aims to save time and costs in project planning by using an AI solution that takes user inputs to generate a project plan with Kanban boards. These AI-driven features enhance productivity, efficiency, and decision-making within a software development team's Jira workflow, and the Jira AI planner can be customized to fit the product design.

### Inputs:
- Rough idea of the project idea, scope and what you want to build in natural language.
- Project timeline.
- No of team members working on the project.
- (Optional) Technology stack intended for use in the project.

### Outputs:
- AI generated kanban board layouts with high-level tasks and sub-tasks required to achieve the project goals within the specified timeline.
- AI generated deliverables and success criteria for the project.
- AI detailed steps and milestones for the project.
